This code finds the closest points in a given set of points using Euclidian distance.

The algorithm runs in O(n^2) and has O(1) space complexity.


Instructions:
    1) Open euclid.py
    2) Insert input file name to the designated area.
    3) Run the code using a preferred IDE. The output file will be generated by the code.
    4) The output file is created with the name "output_sample.txt"
